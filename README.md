Mozilla l10n Automation
---

Mozilla gathers a lot of technical data about it's localizations of Firefox
and other applications. This is the automation that creates that data based
on the localizations on http://hg.mozilla.org/.

Learn details about [the design](http://pike.github.io/a10n/) and how to 
do a [test setup](http://pike.github.io/a10n/test-setup/). You can find the
sources to those pages on the gh-pages branch.

We're using bugzilla for issue tracking, the Infrastructure component in the 
Mozilla Localizations product. Check our 
[buglist](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?short_desc=a10n&resolution=---&query_format=advanced&short_desc_type=allwordssubstr&component=Infrastructure&product=Mozilla%20Localizations).
